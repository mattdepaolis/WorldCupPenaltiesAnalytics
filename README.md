# WorldCupPenaltiesAnalytics

## Summary
Penalty shootouts haven't been around that long. The first penalty shootout was held for the first time in 1982 at the World Cup in Spain, with West Germany beating France in the semifinals. It is one of those things in football that some people love and others detest. They can be very nerve-wracking for the spectators but especially for the professional players and goalkeepers.
The central objective of this paper is to leverage data to resolve queries pertaining to the influence of various factors on the execution of penalty shots. Specifically, this study seeks to discern which elements—attributable to either the player or the goalkeeper—may impact the outcome of penalty taking.

This project was conducted by Matthas De Paolis and Tenzin Rungwatsang
